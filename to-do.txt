Parsing:
    Valid chars (this is aplied only for the map, cause the textures can hold i big range of characters)
    check and store textures path
    check and store the floor and ceiling color
    check if the map is Valid
    Space char validity
    Map is indeed closed by walls






now check if the first half of the config i stored and correct cause if 

color_missing_ceiling_rgb  F 20,20,

if the map has tabs is gets detected as error




first i need to split the lines with whitespaces 
then i need to check if the first index is start with NO or EA or WE or SO or F or C





well now i have a problem in parsing colors 
but what i came by was i a gonna check the index and split it then add it
